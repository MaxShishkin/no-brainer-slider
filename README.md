#No Brainer Slider

This is a small css-driven slider with really simplistic javascript logic.

The goal was to see how far i can get using css transitions with minimum number
of classes and small-possible javascript acting as a state changer.

You can use it as a simple drop-in solution while prototyping, as a blueprint
for more complex work on top or use it standalone as is.
